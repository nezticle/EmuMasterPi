Rendering to a QWindow should be done in a second thread to avoid blocking on glSwapBuffers

Audio code needs to be made safe, as we tend to segfault in cases of buffer underrun.

Default window should be size of emulator, and we should have --fullscreen flag for the stretched view, or maybe a --no-scale for the opposite.

Use QtQuick 2.0 to display emulator, and options/menu
